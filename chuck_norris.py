"""
Binary with 0 and 1 is good, but binary with only 0,
or almost, is even better! Originally, this is a concept
designed by Chuck Norris to send so called unary messages.

Write a program that takes an incoming message as input
and displays as output the message encoded using Chuck Norrisâ€™ method.

Sample input:

C

Sample output:

0 0 00 0000 0 00
