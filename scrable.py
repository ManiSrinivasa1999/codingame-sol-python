"""
When playing ScrabbleÂ©, each player draws 7 letters and must find
a word that scores the most points using these letters.

A player doesn't necessarily have to make a 7-letter word;
the word can be shorter. The only constraint is that the word
must be made using the 7 letters which the player has drawn.

For example, with the letters  etaenhs, some possible
words are: ethane, hates, sane, ant.

Your objective is to find the word that scores the
most points using the available letters (1 to 7 letters).
